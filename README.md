# Monopoly Statistics

Using the random module within Python for dice rolls, this will calculate
the odds of landing on a specific location on a standard monopoly board.
Includes the use of the Community Chest and Chance cards.

Currently only setup for one player but plans are present to make it work
for any number of players. There is also the beginnings of using a Markov
chain to determine the same thing (playing with the mathematics just because).

This project was inspired by the mathematician [Hannah Fry](http://www.hannahfry.co.uk/).
Her book The Indisputable Existence of Santa Clause contains a section which
talks about the statistics calculated here.
